# Computational Neuroscience Project Skeleton

This repository is a skeleton Python package that students in PSYC 5270 can use to get started on their data exploration assignments.

## Getting started

Start by cloning the repository: `git clone https://github.com/melizalab/comp-neurosci-skeleton.git`

This will create a new directory, `comp-neurosci-skeleton`, containing the following items:

- `README.md`: this file
- `setup.py`:  package description file. You will need to edit this.
- `requirements.txt`: a list of packages your code depends on
- `.gitignore`: a list of files git will ignore when telling you what's changed
- `src`:       a directory where you will put your python code
- `test`:      a directory where you will put test code
- `data`:      a directory where your data will live
- `build`:     a directory where processed output from your analysis will live

Choose a new name for your package. Rename the top-level directory (`comp-neurosci-skeleton`) and edit `setup.py` to set the new name and other identifying information.

Now you need to create a github repository of your own. Go to [https://github.com/new](https://github.com/new). Give the repository your chosen name and a description, then click Create Repository. Make a note of the address of your repository. It will look something like `https://github.com/dmeliza/dummy.git`

Finally, set your local directory to track the github repository by running the following commands in your working directory. Replace the repository address in the code below with the one for your project.

``` shell
git remote rm origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/dmeliza/dummy.git
git push -u origin master
```

## Next steps

Edit `data/README.md` to describe how to retrieve data. Better yet, write a script.

Edit `requirements.txt` to add any needed dependencies, then create a virtual environment and install the dependencies as follows:

``` shell
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install the project in development mode by running `python setup.py develop`. If you use notebooks, this will ensure that you can access your modules.

## Project description

This project is for the University of Virginia course PSYC 5270. Contributors to this project are Emily Bishop and Lesley Thomas. The project uses data from the CRCNS repository specifically dataset hc18. Our goal for this project is to reproduce the figures and results that the experimenters produced.
